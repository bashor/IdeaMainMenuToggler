# The project is no longer maintained

* Since **2018.3** *IntelliJ IDEA* has native support of global menu bar on Linux. To get more information see:

  * [IntelliJ IDEA 2018.3 Beta 2 blogpost](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2018/11/intellij-idea-2018-3-beta-2-is-available/)
  * [IntelliJ IDEA Help / Menus and toolbars](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/menus-and-toolbars.html#linux-native-menu)

* I don't use a Linux based OS now and don't use the plugin. So, it's hard to maintain it.
